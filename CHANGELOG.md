# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- modified the implementation of the `.tabelle-arrows` component. Inserting the
  arrows directly into the DOM is now deprecated: we recommend wrapping them
  in a `<fieldset class="tabelle-arrows>`.
  All changes should be backwards compatible, even though the component behaves
  a bit differently now. However, if for some reason the `.tabelle-arrow--asc`
  or `.tabelle-arrow--desc` labels are not wrapped in a `.tabelle-header` class,
  this could cause bugs because the new version uses absolute positioning to
  position the `::after` element of the `.tabelle-arrow--asc` and
  `.tabelle-arrow--desc` in over the nearest parent with `position: relative;`

### Fixed
- Fixed focus for `tabelle-arrows` so it is retained on a `ta-belle` submit
- Fixed `tabelle-cljs` bug when using a custom field for filtering


## [0.5.0] - 2021-05-06
### Changed
- Made `name` optional for `th` header of `tabelle-cljs`
- Added `nofilter` attribute to `ta-belle` and `tabelle-cljs` to deactivate
  automatic generation of filter fields for the whole table


## [0.4.0] - 2021-04-27
### Added
- `tabelle-cljs` component for client-side filtering and sorting
- Added custom CSS properties for customizing `.tabelle-arrow`


## [0.3.1] - 2021-04-16

## [0.2.1] - 2021-01-05
### Changed
- Updated Dependencies


## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-03
### Changed
- Tabelle generates a form next to the HTML table and connects it with the
`form` attribute of the input fields. This is backwards compatible to previous
versions because if developers have taken care to wrap the table in a form
themselves, then this is still supported by Tabelle.
- Added valueCache to prevent form submits when the value of the input field
hasn't changed. This also fixes a bug with Firefox which fires events both on
'keyup' and 'change' and deduplicates them.
